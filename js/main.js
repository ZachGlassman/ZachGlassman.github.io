So a relevant first discussion would be how this website was created.\n\nThis website was written using a Bootstrap theme controlled with AngularJS and the markdown on the blog rendered with Showndown.  Lets discuss each of these individually.\n\n### Bootstrap\n\nThe Bootstrap contains the basic CSS and HTML structure of the website.  I think it provides a nice look and is easily customizable.  It provides an easy HTML structure for the rest of the website.  However, I did not want to write each page completely individually, it seems that things like the header and the footer should only have to be written once.  I played with some static site generators such as Hugo, but found that I was putting too much work into making the site display exactly as I wanted, it would have been easier to just write every page myself.  Therefore, I took the plunge into AngularJS\n\n### AngularJS\n\nAngularJS is a framework that allows abstract definitions of how to view data.  This means that instead of defining every individual element of a webpage, we can define how to view a *model*.
