            <p>I am trying the pages service on github to create my own webpages.  The git system is great for developing projects including websites.  More content will be coming soon                about me, what I do, some projects I have worked on, and more.  For a start check out my class notes for several undergraduate and one graduate math course.</p>

             <a name"spec" class="anchor" href="spec"><span class="oticon oticon-link"></span></a>Physics Research</h3>
            <p>My physics research focues on the study of diatomic molecules encompasses both experimental work and computer simulation and fitting. The experiment work occurs at  both Arizona State University and Leibnitz University in Hannover, Germany.</p>
            <p>My current focus is on data analysis techniques particularly on leveraging multi-isotope models to increase parameter sensitivity and finding breakdown in quantum chemical approximations. My current focus is on quanitfying the breakdown of the finite nuclear size approximation in heavy diatomics which should help understand parity violating effects.</p>
            <p>As part of my research I have written many programs, mostly in Python to aid in understanding and fitting spectra.  On my Spectroscopy programs page I have placed some of the code for this.  In addition, Herb Pickett from JPL has written a marvelous suite of programs SPCAT/SPFIT which are the standard fitting routines for microwave data.  However, due to their generality, they are notoriously difficult to use.  I have written several partial front ends that do things from creation of input files to visualiation of output from this program.  I also have an example program that one can use to understand at least the basic structure of the routines in SPFIT (although they are not nearly as sophisticated).  I also plan to write a guide to the program for the beginner as part of my senior thesis project.  These can all be found at the link below.</p>
