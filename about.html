            <p>I was born in Madison, CT, a little seaside town, but have spent my last four years in Claremont, California, a small city near Los Angeles.  I come from a large family, but particularly miss my dogs as they have rather terrible phone skills. </p>

            <p>I am a big sports fan, particularly New York teams such as the Giants and the Rangers.  I grew up playing Ice Hockey and Lacrosse, two sports which sadly are not very popular out on the west coast.</p>
            <p>When I want a break from quantitative thought, I enjoy reading those large series of fantasy novels which unfortunatly tend to outlive their authors.  For those of you who liked Game of Thrones are wondering where to find a similiar series, I would recommend Steven Erikson Malazan Book of the Fallen series whose first book can be found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gardens-Moon-Malazan-Book-Fallen/dp/0765348780">here</a>.</p>
