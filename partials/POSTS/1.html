Visualizing Riemann Sums
June 20, 2015

Riemann sums are one of the first things learned when beginning the study of integration.  Yet often they are presented as a theoretical underpinning and then quickly forgotten as the *rules* of integration are hammered into memory.  While they do not allow for easy computation of integrals, they are an excellent glimpse into the nature of the integral.

First we will consider a straight line with equation \(f(x) = sx\), a straight line with slope \(s\).  We can plot it as shown in the following figure.  You can play around with the slope by moving the slider.

So now we want to *integrate* this simple function, but what does that mean?  If we look up integrate on google, we get
>
> #### integrate
> combine one thing with another so that they become whole.

So it appears we want to do some sort of combining or adding.  To proceed, we must first define the problem which we are trying to solve.  Informally, we can state this as

>
> Given a function \(f(x)\) find the area of the region, \(R\) in the x-y plane subject to the following conditions
> * \(R\) is always between \(f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis
> * The area above the \(x\)-axis is positive and the area below is negative
> * \(R\) is bounded by the vertial lines \(x=a\) and \(x=b\).

Those who have studied some calculus recognize that we can state this problem without the last condition, although without the last condition, our problem is not to compute the area of \(R\), but rather to find a function which represents the area of \(R\).  For now, we will assume all the conditions.

If we go back to our example of a line, and let \(a=-5,b=5\), then we can write our statement of the problem as
$$R = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.$$

The curly sign simply means we want to find all the area and the function is any one we choose, in this case \(f(x) =s x\).  However, at this point you may be bothered by the $dx$ at the end.  \(dx\) is not technically a number, but we can think of it as the limit of one.  For now, we will say that it is some sort of distance along the \(x\)-axis, we will develop understanding of its nature through the Riemann sum.

The plot below shows the problem we are trying to solve where \((R\)) is the blue region minus the red region.  Again you can move the slider to see how the region changes.

For this specific case, the region is always composed of two right triangular regions, one red, one blue.  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle which is
$$ A = \frac{ h \times b}{2},$$
where \(h\) is the height and \(b\) is the base of the triangle (not to be confused with $b$ the right bound of integration), to compute this area.  For both regions, we know that the base of the triangle is \(b=5\). The height for the blue side is \(f(5)=5s\) and the height for the red side is \(f(-5)= -5s\).  So the region is given as
$$R = A_{blue}-A_{red} = \frac{25s}{2}-\frac{25s}{2}=0,$$
so in this case, the solution to the integral problem is zero.

Lets take a moment and see if this is surprising.  We know that the function \(f(x)=sx\) is anti-symmetric with respect to reflection over the $y$ axis in the sense that \(f(x) = -f(-x)\).  So it makes sense if we take any region where \(a=-b\), then the areas will always exactly cancel each other out.  However, if \(a\neq -b\), then we will get a non-zero answer.
It is easy enough to do this problem for general $a$ and $b$, which is given as
$$R = \frac{sb^2}{2}-\frac{sa^2}{2},$$
make sure you understand how to get to this formula before you continue.

The following app illustrates allows you to change the slope, $a$, and $b$, and will compute the slope.

Notice that in this easy case, we are able to get by just knowing about triangles.  However, we have discovered one, very essential detail, **We can solve the problem by breaking it into pieces**.  In the previous case, these pieces were two triangles and we were able to get an exact answer, but now we will on to more complicated function where this will not be sufficent to get an exact answer.

Let us consider the slightly more complicated function
$$f(x) = \sin(x) + \frac{x}{8},$$
which is shown in the plot below.

<script src = "/Graphs/sinplot.js"></script>
<div class="plotdiv" id="78bbf997-72bb-4bcc-9e3e-aeb7c39e231b"></div>

We can see that triangles don't really make sense, so we choose to use the simplest shape we can, a rectangle.  The following will get slightly technical, but the basic idea is that we will divide the range we want to integrate over into equally spaced regions \(\Delta x\).  We will then approximate the curve in each region by a rectange and add them up.  As we make \(\Delta x\) smaller, we will achieve a better approximation to the integral.  In the limit that \(\Delta x \to 0\), we have solved our problem.

More formally, divide the interval \([a,b]\) into \(n\) subintervals, which all have equal length \(\Delta x\) given as
$$\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}.$$
This is usually referred to as a *parition* of the interval.  We can write out the elements of the partition as
$$P = \{a,a+\Delta x, a + 2\Delta x,\dots,a + (n-1)\Delta x, b\}$$
We can then define the left Riemann sum as the approximation where we take the value of the function at the left of each element of the parition \(p_i\) and create a rectange with one side \(f(p_i)\) and the other side \(\Delta x\).  So we then form the Left Riemann sum
$$S = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_{i-1})(x_i-x_{i-1}).$$
If we replace \(f(x_{i-1})\) with \(f(x_{i})\) in this expression, we get the right Riemann sum.  In principle, we could use any value \(f(x^*)\) with the caveat that
$$x_{i-1}\leq x^* \leq x_{i}$$
For our specific example, then app, shows this formalism applied to our function.  The lower right plot shows the dependance of the sum on \(n\), where \(n\) is the number of partitions.  Notice that the Left and Right Riemann sums are not in general equal, however, they approach each other, as well as the correct answer as $n$ gets large.

In the limit that \(\Delta x \to 0\),(\(n \to \infty\) ), for a properly *behaved* function, this converges to the integral.  The exact details of this are quite complicated and if you are interested, I point you to the Real Analysis notes in the Notes section of this website which have a much more rigourous derivation.

We are now ready to say that \(dx\) is an infinitly small segment of the real line.  Integration is the act of adding infinitesimally narrow rectangles together to find the area of the curve.  Although outside the scope of this post, we could use the fundamnetal theorem of calculus to compute that
$$\int_a^b \sin(x) + \frac{x}{8} = \left(-\cos(b)+\frac{b^2}{16}\right)-\left(-\cos(a)+\frac{a^2}{16}\right),$$
which answers the question of integration for this function.

Lastly, it is always useful to know how to compute these things youreslf.  The following is an IPython notebook (written in Python), which shows how to caclulate the Riemann sums and even compute a numerical answer using advanced methods.
