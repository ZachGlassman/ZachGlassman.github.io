Visualizing Riemann Sums
June 20, 2015

Riemann sums are one of the first things learned when beginning the study of integration.  Yet often they are presented as a theoretical underpinning and then quickly forgotten as the *rules* of integration are hammered into memory.  While they do not allow for easy computation of integrals, they are an excellent glimpse into the nature of the integral.

First we will consider a straight line with equation $f(x) = sx$, a straight line with slope $s$.  We can plot it as shown in the following figure.  You can play around with the slope by moving the slider.

So now we want to *integrate* this simple function, but what does that mean?  If we look up integrate on google, we get
> #### integrate

> combine one thing with another so that they become whole.

So it appears we want to do some sort of combining or adding.  To proceed, we must first define the problem which we are trying to solve.  Informally, we can state this as

> Given a function $f(x)$ find the area of the region, $R$ in the x-y plane subject to the following conditions
>
> * $R$ is always between $f(x)$ and the $x$-axis
> * The area above the $x$-axis is positive and the area below is negative
> * $R$ is bounded by the vertial lines $x=a$ and $x=b$.

Those who have studied some calculus recognize that we can state this problem without the last condition, although without the last condition, our problem is not to compute the area of $R$, but rather to find a function which represents the area of $R$.  For now, we will assume all the conditions.

If we go back to our example of a line, and let $a=-5,b=5$, then we can write our statement of the problem as
$$R = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.$$

The curly sign simply means we want to find all the area and the function is any one we choose, in this case $f(x) =s x$.  However, at this point you may be bothered by the $dx$ at the end.  $dx$ is not technically a number, but we can think of it as the limit of one.  For now, we will say that it is some sort of distance along the $x$-axis, we will develop understanding of its nature through the Riemann sum.

The plot below shows the problem we are trying to solve where $R$ is the blue region minus the red region.  Again you can move the slider to see how the region changes.

For this specific case, the region is always composed of two right triangular regions, one red, one blue.  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle which is
$$ A = \frac{ h \times b}{2},$$
where $h$ is the height and $b$ is the base of the triangle (not to be confused with $b$ the right bound of integration), to compute this area.  For both regions, we know that the base of the triangle is $b=5$. The height for the blue side is $f(5)=5s$ and the height for the red side is $f(-5)= -5s$.  So the region is given as
$$R = A_{blue}-A_{red} = \frac{25s}{2}-\frac{25s}{2}=0,$$
so in this case, the solution to the integral problem is zero.

Lets take a moment and see if this is surprising.  We know that the function $f(x)=sx$ is anti-symmetric with respect to reflection over the $y$ axis in the sense that $f(x) = -f(-x)$.  So it makes sense if we take any region where $a=-b$, then the areas will always exactly cancel each other out.  However, if $a\neq -b$, then we will get a non-zero answer.
It is easy enough to do this problem for general $a$ and $b$, which is given as
$$R = \frac{sb^2}{2}-\frac{sa^2}{2},$$
make sure you understand why this is before you continue.  The following app illustrates this and allows you to change $a$ and $b$.  It calculates the area according to the formula above.
