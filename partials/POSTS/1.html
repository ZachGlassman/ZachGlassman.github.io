Visualizing Riemann Sums
June 20, 2015

Riemann sums are one of the first things learned when beginning the study of integration.  Yet often they are presented as a theoretical underpinning and then quickly forgotten as the *rules* of integration are hammered into memory.  While they do not allow for easy computation of integrals, they are an excellent glimpse into the nature of the integral.

First we will consider a straight line with equation \(y = x\), a straight line.  We can plot it as shown in the following figure.  You can play around with the slope by moving the slider.
<script src = "/js/lineplot.js">
</script>
<div class="plotdiv" id="96d89225-138d-4052-b636-36ceb3839a08"></div>
So now we want to *integrate* this simple function, but what does that mean?  If we look up integrate on google, we get
> integrate
> combine one thing with another so that they become whole.

So it appears we want to do some sort of combining or adding.
