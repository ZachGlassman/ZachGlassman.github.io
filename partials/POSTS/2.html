Delta Function Potential
June 21, 2015

Find the wavefunctions and energies of a 1-D particle of mass m in the potential
\begin{equation}
V(x) = V\_0 a \delta(x),
\end{equation}
so we want to solve the Schrodinger equation
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\psi(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x),
\end{equation}
where $-\infty\lt x\lt \infty$.  So our general idea will be to solve the equation for $x \lt 0$ and for $x \gt 0$ and join at the origin.  The free particle solutions can be written as
\begin{align}
\psi\_- &= A \sin(kx) + B\cos(kx)\\
\psi\_+ &= C \sin(kx)+ D\cos(kx),
\end{align}
where $k$ is not necessarily real and defined by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} = E.
\end{equation}
Our two general boundary conditions are given by the continuity of the wavefunction at $x=0$ and if we integrate both sides of the Schrodinger equation from $-\epsilon $ to $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon \to 0$, we must retain equality.  More explicitly, we have that
\begin{align}
\psi_-(0)&=\psi_+(0)\\
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon \psi''(x)\, dx + \int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon V_0 a \delta(x) \psi(x)\,dx &= \int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon E\psi(x),
\end{align}
and we can simplify the equation by noting that $\psi$ is continuous, thus $\int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon E\psi(x)=0$ and by using the definition of the delta function, we get for the second condition
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}[\psi'(x)]_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon + V_0 a \psi(0) = 0,
\end{equation}
which leads to the two conditions
\begin{align}
B &=D\\
\label{1ddelta}
\frac{\hbar^2k}{2m}[C-A]&=V_0aB
\end{align}
Now we must consider the cases of a bound state and a scattering state.
\subsubsection{Bound State}
For this state, we require the wavefunction be normalizable, so we require that
\begin{equation}
\lim_{x\to \pm \infty}\psi(x) = 0.
\end{equation}
So in order to have this, we know $k$ must be imaginary, so we define $\kappa = ik$, which gives us that
\begin{equation}
\psi_- = A\left(\frac{e^{-\kappa x}-e^{\kappa x}}{2i}\right) + B\left(\frac{e^{-\kappa x}+e^{\kappa x}}{2}\right),
\end{equation}
and if we require this to be zero at $-\infty$< we get that $A=-iB$ by noting that the term pre-multiplying the divergent exponential, must be zero.  Similar considerations for $\psi_+$ gives that $C=iD$.  Since we know that
\begin{equation}
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar},
\end{equation}
and $k$ is imaginary, we must have $E<0$.

We now have four equations, which allows us to write using \eqref{1ddelta}
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2 k}{m}=V_0 a B,
\end{equation}
which implies that
\begin{equation}
\kappa = -\frac{maV_0}{\hbar^2},
\end{equation}
which implies that $V_0 a$ must be negative to get a bound state and there is only one bound state.  We can write the energy of this bound state as
\begin{equation}
E = -\frac{\hbar^2\kappa^2}{2m} = -\frac{ma^2V_0^2}{2\hbar^2},
\end{equation}
which lets us write the wavefunction
\begin{align}
\psi_- &= Be^{\kappa x}\\
\psi_+ &= -Ce^{-\kappa x},
\end{align}
and so using the fact that $B=-C$, we get that
\begin{equation}
\psi(x) = Be^{-\kappa |x|},
\end{equation}
and we could determine $B$ by normalization.
\subsubsection{Scattering States}
For these states, we can project onto the delta states which gives the idea of a forward and backward traveling state.
