            <h2>Graduate School</h2>
            <p>I am a second year graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park studying Chemical physics.
            I work at the Joint Quantum Institute which is a collaboration between UMD and the National Institute of Standards and
            Technology (NIST), a government research organization located in Gaithersberg, MD.  I am a member of the Laser Cooling and Trapping group
            and work under Dr. Paul Lett.  My course work to date has focused on Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Chemistry, and Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics.  I am working towards a Ph.D which I hope to complete in a few years</p>
