            <h2>Graduate School</h2>
            <p>I am a second year graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park studying Chemical physics.
            I work at the Joint Quantum Institute which is a collaboration between UMD and the National Institute of Standards and
            Technology (NIST), a government research organization located in Gaithersburg, MD.  I am a member of the Laser Cooling and Trapping group
            and work under Dr. Paul Lett.
            <p>My course work to date has focused on Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Chemistry, and Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics.  I am working towards a Ph.D which I hope to complete in a few years.  I am interested in problems that arise at the union of chemistry and physics, namely the quantum description of atoms and molecules. </p>

            <h2>Undergradate</h2>
            <p>I recieved my undergraduate degree from Pomona College in Claremont, CA where I doubled majored in Physics and Mathematics.  I both wrote a thesis and published a paper in a peer reviewed journal in each subject.</p>

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
            <p>I am also intersted in education, math and physics education and a high school and undergraduate level.  I believe that new advances in technology can change how we teach and learn and hopefully appeal to a greater number of students with varied learning patterns.  On my projects page you can find some simple javascript apps which interactively demonstrate concepts in these fields. </p>
