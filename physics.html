<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

     <p>My current focus is on data analysis techniques particularly on leveraging multi-isotope models to increase parameter sensitivity and finding breakdown in quantum chemical approximations. My current focus is on quanitfying the breakdown of the finite nuclear size approximation in heavy diatomics which should help understand parity violating effects.</p>
            <p>The idea behind this research is understanding the energy structure of molecules.  This is the energy level structure of ThO, an interesting molecule for measurement of the eEDM, the electric dipole moment of the electron.</p>

            <p>As part of my research I have written many programs, mostly in Python to aid in understanding and fitting spectra.  On my Spectroscopy programs page I have placed some of the code for this.  In addition, Herb Pickett from JPL has written a marvelous suite of programs SPCAT/SPFIT which are the standard fitting routines for microwave data.  However, due to their generality, they are notoriously difficult to use.  I have written several partial front ends that do things from creation of input files to visualiation of output from this program.  I also have an example program that one can use to understand at least the basic structure of the routines in SPFIT (although they are not nearly as sophisticated).  I also plan to write a guide to the program for the beginner as part of my senior thesis project.
